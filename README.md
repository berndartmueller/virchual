# Virtual Swiper

This typescript swiper aims to provide a high-performance swiper carousel best used when multiple instances on a page are necessary (e.g. list of cards where each card has a swiper gallery - Airbnb, Hometogo,...).

To achieve this goal, this swiper carousel uses virtual slides to only render those slides which are really necessary.
